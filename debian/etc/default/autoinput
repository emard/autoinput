# To beep after each value, PC speaker can be used.
# (pc speaker is really an output-only device, but it is
# supported by kernel driver in "linux input layer device")
# It features sound output and no input.
#pcspeaker="/dev/input/pc_speaker"

# for values >= 0 add prefix '+'
#plus=1

# add leading zeros, like 00000.0
#zero=1

# delay between keypress actions in microseconds
#key_delay=2000

# Choose type of keys layout that mitutoyo will generate:
# "num" for numeric pad or
# "key" for keypad
#key_layout="num"
key_layout="key"

# to further and more precisely accommodate to each
# perticual keyboard and application, we can assign 
# complex key sequences.
# key sequence is a comma separated list of
# key names, It can be key name e.g. MINUS. It means
# press MINUS and release MINUS. 
# Keys are named mostly as they appear on US keyboard.
# Each Key can be prefixed with optional + or - sign 
# to specify is the key pressed down (+) or released (-).
# This is used whern some keys should be held down pressed 
# while other keys are typed.
# e.g. plus sign on US keyboad is obtained by
# shift-equal which can be written here as:
# key_plus="+LEFTSHIFT,EQUAL,-LEFTSHIFT"

# key sequence before the value
#key_before=""

# key sequence for plus sign
#key_plus="KPPLUS"

# key sequence for plus sign
#key_minus="KPMINUS"

# key sequence for decimal point
#key_point="KPDOT"

# key sequence to after the value
#key_after="DOWN"
